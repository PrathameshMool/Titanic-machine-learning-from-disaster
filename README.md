# Kaggle Titanic survival Machine learning project 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
* Entry for Kaggle Beginner challenge on Machine learning which helped in
prediction of the survival of passengers in the titanic disaster.

* Started with exploratory data analysis of data set across features like gender
distribution, passenger class distribution, survival rate, siblings using jupyter
notebooks and python modules like Seaborn, matplotlib, Numpy and pandas.

* Trained the data set across Machine learning models like Logistic Regression,
Gaussian Naive Bays and Cat boost cross-validation algorithm

* The project was 70 % more efficient and predicted the results correctly.
